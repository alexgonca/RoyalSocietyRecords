Royal Society Election Records
==============================

I coded this Java program to web scrap [The Royal Society election records](https://collections.royalsociety.org/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=FastTree.tcl&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqItem=EC%252F1975&dsqField=RefNo#HERE). The generated CSV file has been used by my MIT colleague Jia Zhang in her [data visualization project](http://www.dataminding.org/jiazhang/index.php?/comparative-trajectories/).
